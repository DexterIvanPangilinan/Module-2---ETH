# Project Title
Smart Contract Management - ETH + AVAX

# Description
One specialized resource that lets people build blockchain networks and develop Dapps without middlemen is called Avalanche. Avalanche aims to be the solution for standard blockchain systems' problems with throughput and scalability. Because of the Avalanche consensus protocol, the platform offers remarkably quick transactions and finality in milliseconds. Developers may create blockchain networks with unique features and those that are most required by use cases thanks to Avalanche's layered architecture, which can adapt to scalability difficulties.
